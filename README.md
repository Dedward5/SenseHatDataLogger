# Motor Sport Data Logger
A racing car data logger based on the Raspberry Pi Sense hat

This is for a NON ODB based vehicle. The intention is to initialy only use the SenseHat based inputs to record data for a racing car being used for Sprint and Hillclimb racing, however it could apply to general track use.

# Features

* Accelerometer data from Sense Hat
* "Magic" timer start when car moves
* Video from Raspberry Pi Camera
* Overlay of data onto recorded video
* Audio capture vis USB mic (needs post production work to add to video)
* GPS for Lat/Lon and Speed
* RPM Input to GPIO (requires simple circuit)

# Credits
To get started I drew heavily on the code examples here

# Documentation
Please __read the docs__ in the ../docs folder to find out how to install and use the datalogger
